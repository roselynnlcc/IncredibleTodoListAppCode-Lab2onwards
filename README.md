# Introduction
The repository contains Lab Assignments of Fall 2023 Mobile Application Development.

- Lab Assignment 1: [Spinning Up React Native App](https://github.com/roselynnlcc/IncredibleTodoListApp) 

- Lab Assignment 2 (Initial Commit): 
Refactor React Native code into ToDoList and ToDoForm components to enhance organization and maintainability

- Lab Assignment 3: Props and State Management
A list of hard-coded list of tasks is created in the App.jsx file and then passedto the ToDoList component.

- Lab Assignment 4: Event Handling & State Lifting
Task addition to the ToDo List was implemented through form interaction, leveraging state management and event handling in React.

- Lab Assignment 5: Navigation and Routing
Routing and navigation are implemented to set up different screens. Users are enabled to navigate between them within the app.


# React Native Descriptions:
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Objective
This React Native project involves initial code for a ToDo list and form in a React Native app. The main objective is to refactor this code into separate components, ToDoList and ToDoForm, to enhance code organization and maintainability. This lab assignment focuses on applying modularity principles in React development.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
